# Advent of Code 2022

This repository holds my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022.

I've decided to use a different Programming Languages every 3 days so the learning curve for the used programming languages may increase.

I may ocassionaly add a Readme in each day folder to explain the problem a bit and explain my code

In the following you can see on which days, which programming languages have been used.



1. Day 1-3: C++
2. Day 4-6: Python3
3. Day 7-9: Java
4. Day 10-12: ???
5. Day 13-15: ???
6. Day 16-18: ???
7. Day 19-21: ???
8. Day 22-24: ???
